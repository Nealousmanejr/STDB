<p id="paragraph1">The following data is to show the statistics of Gonorrhea. The data is shown to represent the years of 1941-2016. This is an 75 year period. As you can see, the data shown is out of a population of 100,000 people. The rates of this disease is neither linear or exponential. It begans to grow and then have sudden decreases. In this graph the highest number of the 100,000 people that obtained gonorrhea was 500. The year of 1977 was when there was the most amount of people with gonorrhea out of this population.</p>

<p id="paragraph2">The table here shows a number of things. It shows not only how many people have this disease(gonorrhea) out of 100,000 but it also show's the people age. Our target ages are from 15-24, therefore those are the main ages we will be focused on. In between ages 20-24 this disease is most obtained out of the population. This was sort of expected just because this is the age where young adults are sexually active with partners. This is why our BOX will help young adults to be more aware if they have an STD when sexually active.</p>
