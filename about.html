	<p id="ajani">Hi! My name is AjaniMadu Logan. I am from Compton and Inglewood. I grew up with only my sister and mother until she got married a few years ago. I come from a house of authors, with my mom having a 19 series book novel with 20 books in total and my step-father having 25 total books. I grew up liking to read but I now have other interest. I enjoy playing games such as Minecraft and Call of Duty. I also enjoy watching YouTube. Some channels I enjoy are MKBHD, Berd and Bill Wurtz.I don't know what I want to do in my future career wise, but I am interested in technology, biology and literature. I am a rising sophomore and I am in gifted classes(GFT), advanced placement(AP) and international baccalaureate(IB). I enjoy learning about different types of technology and how they evolved. For example, I am very interested in the evolution of smartphone cameras. I am also interested in cells. I always found cell structure interesting and very easy. I do not know if I want to partake in any of these careers however.
